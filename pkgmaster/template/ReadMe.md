## Development

### Unreleased Changes &nbsp;<sub>[![][commitsimg]][latest] [![][devdocs-img]][devdocs]</sub>

For the latest commit on `main` (aka _dev_ and _unstable_):

| CI status | <sub>[![][testsimg]][tests]</sub> | <sub>[![][docbuildimg]][docbuild]</sub> |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|

You can install `{{{PKG}}}` at this latest commit using
```
pkg> add https://github.com/tfiers/{{{PKG}}}.jl
```
It might be a good idea to install at a fixed revision instead.
Preferably at a [commit that passed tests][testhist].
For example:
```
pkg> add https://github.com/tfiers/{{{PKG}}}.jl#{commit-hash}
```
