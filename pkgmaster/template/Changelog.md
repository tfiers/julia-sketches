# Changelog

A summary of the changes introduced in each new version of `{{{PKG}}}`.

<details><summary>
The version numbers roughly follow <a href="https://semver.org">SemVer</a>
<sub>(expand for details).</sub>
</summary>

  The version format is `major.minor.patch`,\
  with the latter two '`0`' if not specified.

  For versions â‰¥ `v1`, we try to guarantee that `minor` version increases 
  are not breaking, i.e. that they are backwards compatible.
  
  Before `v1` (so at `v0.x`), minor versions may be (and mostly are) breaking.
  
  `major` version increases are breaking, i.e. they can make existing
  code error.
  
  `patch` versions are for e.g. bugfixes.

<sub>With thanks to [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) for the format and inspiration.</sub>
